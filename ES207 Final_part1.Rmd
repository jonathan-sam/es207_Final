##*This demonstration is intended for an example for ES 207 final, and it is not offical results

```{r}
#Sierra Nevada MTBS Fire Data and Climate data, truncated to only include severity, climate, and other indicators such as year and month
head(sevclim.sn) #sev = severity, clim = climate, sn = sierra nevada
dim(sevclim.sn)
#Threshold in order from low to high respectively
threshold
#Covariate inputs into scale and shape parameters, in order from low to high respectively 
scale.param
shape.param

library(texmex)
#jas.migpd is an edited function from library texmex, function migpd. jas.migpd was edited to allow for covariate inputs, migpd is a wrapper for the function evm, which models extreme value models (hence evm) jas. in front of any texmex function was edited to allow for covarite input
#?migpd
# When using jas.migpd, the three fire severity classes (low, moderate, high) must be the first three columns in the dataset
sn.GPDs <- jas.migpd(sevclim.sn, mth = threshold, sc = scale.param, sh = shape.param)
sn.GPDs$models
